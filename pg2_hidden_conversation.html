What occurred was </p>
<p class="visable"> not my fault, no not that. 
Accidental? ummm </p>
<p class= "paragraph"> unintentional, completely
	regrettable. And I am truly sorry </p> 
<p class="visable"> that you took
it the way you did, that you interpreted my 
words in that way… no use ‘I’ language</p>
<p class="paragraph"> if I offended any of you at all. I don’t expect to be 
forgiven for the things I said and did</p>
<p class="visable"> regarding that particular group of people, wait that might 
	sound wrong,</p> 
<p class="paragraph"> but I am here to say sorry.</p>
<p class="visable"> Now a promise but, will it happen again? I don’t know
	that I can promise that. </p>
<p class="paragraph"> What I can do is promise to </p>
<p class="visable"> try to be better in the public eye- no 
	vaguer, </p>
<p class="paragraph"> work on being better, observing myself
	and trying my best to improve upon myself.</p>
<p class="visable">Be strong you got it, </p>
<p class="paragraph">I am taking all accountability
and responsibility for these actions. I have tried 
to act in a way that would make those around 
	me proud, but I failed </p>
<p class="visable"> on that day, wait no I
shouldn’t put a time stamp on this. I thought 
	I was doing well.</p>
<p class="paragraph"> But now I am aware of the extent 
	of the impact of my actions.</p>
<p class="visable">I said to myself what
	I did was okay, no no no - come on! </p>
<p class="paragraph"> It was not okay for 
	me to do these things. </p>
<p class="visable"> What can I say so they know
	I am sorry? </p>
<p class="paragraph"> There is nothing here I will forgive
myself for, and I don’t expect to be forgiven, 
	but I hope we can move past this. </p>
